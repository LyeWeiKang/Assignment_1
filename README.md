# JayChou's Website
My website is a singer website which aims to help a singer to gain popularity through their songs, albums and concerts and at the same time,also let their fans have a deeper understanding of them.

Through the website,the public will be able to gain more knowledge of the singer as they will be updated with the latest news,songs,concerts and upcoming merchandises.
# Design Process
This website is mainly targetted at the fans of the singer and general public who want to know more about this singer. The targetted audience would definitely like to find out more about the singer and my project is the best way to help them achieve these things since it consists of large chunk of relative information about the singer which include the biography of the singer, the latest albums, concert dates and latest MV produced.

As a user type, I want to read the biography of the singer so that I can know the singer's background information.

As a user type, I want to know the latest albums and hear the track of it so that i wont miss out any new albums.

As a user type,I want to know the date,location and time of concert so that I wont miss out any of the concerts of the singer.

As a user type,I want to hear the latest songs,mvs of the singer so that i will know how they will sound like which will be useful for me when making decisions on the songs that I am going to save in my playlist.

As a user type,I want to see all the merchandise and albums of the singer that are for sale so that I can decide on which to buy.

As a user type, I want to subscribe to the letter box so that i can get the latest update of the singer.

As a user type, I want to know all the social medias of the singer so that I can follow them to receive the latest updates of them.

## WireFrame
../WireFrame/WireFrame(assignment).xd
I did not completely follow the wireframe that i designed.I scrapped out Sections like past concert as I realise that is not really visually appealing after implementing it into the website. In addition, after looking at most of the official websites for singer as references, I realise that they also did not have the section on past tours which make my decision firmer in scraping out that section.  I also did add sections like Latest merchandise,latest video into the website which was not included in wireframe.This was to make the homepage to look more interesting and not so plain. Apart from this, the rest of the sections of the website remain the same as the wireframe.

Instead of vertical navigation bar, it changed to a drop down navigation bar and will be in white in colour as compared to previous colour black when being run on pc/laptop. In addition, instead of many items being displayed in one row, it will change to a single item being displayed for each row when the website runs on phone.

Displayed on normal pc/laptop:


Displayed on phone:

There is a interesting bug that i encounter. When i am trying to navigate from music page to store page on the phone, instead of bringing me to the store, it will bring me to the  website that i get the video from instead. This happen because of the video link in the music page is too close to the storepage link that is in the navigation bar.
